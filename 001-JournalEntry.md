## Noke Ranoke (Day of Days) Year 1036

I am sitting alone on an alien beach with a few pieces of wreckage for company. There's an abandoned lighthouse in the distance. The body of the captain floats in the shallows. The Messenger Orb is somewhere in the sea.

We were sailing for Gatziba, a small port on the mainland. The captain and first mate knew the head of a small trading company there before the war. I struggled on deck with the rest of the crew against a squall that picked up. We were trying to avoid a small cold water current with summer so near.

I guessed that we found it square. I heard the captain curse herself and the old map.

Pitching into the waves, our ship yawned up and over the waves. We struggled to keep our feet under us. After an hour, we got past the worst of it. There was a patch of blue sky in the distance off the starboard side, but we stayed the course toward the port. We were looking for the lighthouse light.

The seas calmed enough for the crew and I to bunk for awhile. Many of them went to grab something to eat, but I went below to rest my aching back. I had been away from the sea for too many years. I climbed into a hammock and fell asleep.

I woke to a deafening crack. I thought we'd run aground, but the hollering above deck told me otherwise. I ran up the stairs and saw the front of the ship separate away from me. The crew was thrown overboard as the weight of the water in the bow pulled it under. The aft section I stood on pitched up and back. We were filling with water and sinking fast.

"Korahd! Where are you!"

There was no sight of my friend. The ship lurched and I was thrown overboard. The water was surprisingly warm. When my head came above water, I heard the wreckage creaking and both parts of the ship sinking. I swam to the nearest piece of wreckage expecting to find others. I laid on a piece a bit larger than me. I called out to Korahd. The last thing I remember was a hot stabbing pain on the back of my head.

"Welcome to Pella's Column. You're stuck here like the rest of us. You'll get used to it in time."

I heard those words four years ago when I first arrived on the island. Korahd said them to me blankly with just the slightest hint of pity. They assumed that a human wouldn't understand the language of the elves. 

"I've been here over 32 years," they continued, "and no sorcery or ancestral call will grant me passage home."

Switching to another language, Korahd apologized, made introductions, and asked me where I arrived from.

"All I remember," I replied in Elvish, "was that I was talking to my crew about the cargo below decks and suddenly I woke up to you staring at me like an idiot."

Korahd and I made our way to the largest city, Zegra. The mayor and the head of the shipping guild were looking to reopen trade routes with the mainland. The war isolated the island and attempts to reconnect hadn't been successful. It seemed that calling a truce and ending hostilities are two separate things.

"Sometimes this place feels like home," I thought to myself.

We stopped at a coffeehouse to see what the locals were talking about and to share a good cup. I grabbed a table in the corner close to a window. Korahd laughed at my old habits.

"You still think someone from the old country will show up here?" they asked. 

The breadth of the peoples in this land were all there, many speculated about the mayor and the head of the shipping guild. Many were looking to get off the island like me, but for different reasons.  I am going to Junesal, a kingdom of portals. The locals scoffed at the stories. They told me that Junesal is a new kingdom with weak-minded king. It only exists as a buffer between two hostile countries.

I ordered a cup and watched the patrons of the coffeehouse.

It's late spring and the sun shined warmly on the town square. My wide brimmed hat provided a bit of shade. The mayor explained that the shipping company was looking for volunteers to explore the mainland and report back what we found. The ships were loaded with coffee beans, roasted and raw.

The journey was expected to be a couple of days. I was assigned a ship heading for Gatziba, a place farther north than where I really wanted to go. The paymaster made it very clear that I wasn't hired to express my desires, but the work on deck. I was glad that Korahd was assigned the same crew. The only oddity with me was the Messenger Orb I was given to be able to talk to the shipping company. I took my sack of clothes and sundries and boarded the Tiger's Eye with my friend.

That's the last I remember talking to them.
