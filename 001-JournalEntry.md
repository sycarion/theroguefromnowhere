## Noke Ranoke (Day of Days)

"Welcome to Pella's Column. You're stuck here like the rest of us. You'll get used to it in time."

I heard those words four years ago when I first arrived on the island. Korahd said them to me blankly with just the slightest hint of pity. They assumed that a human wouldn't understand the language of the elves. 

"I've been here over 32 years," they continued, "and no sorcery or ancestral call will grant me passage home."

Switching to another language, Korahd apologized and asked me where I arrived from.
